## **Description**

The purpose of this assignment was to create a command line application that allows a manager of a team to easily create a bio page for their team that included their name, email, ID, and either their Github username or current school. They were supposed to be allowed to create any number of either Engineer or Intern employees, so they much be constantly prompted to add more employees until they go through their entire team.  Once they are finished inputting their team info, it should add that information to an html file, thus creating the page.  

The two main things I struggled with when tyting to complete this assignment were making the questions continue endlessly so the manager can add more than one person, and also linking the responses to the html page.
